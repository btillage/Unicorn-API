Why did you choose to organize your data schemas/models in a particular way?

The reason I chose to organize my models with only two varying types either a ride or a unicorn is because that is the only knowledge we are being asked to acces/store.


Feel free to talk a bit about the "harder" routes that you worked on and how you approached them â€” harder is completely subjective, so feel free to get creative here!

The harder route that I worked on was the longest rider. Reasons were that a parameter was now being passed in and there was also filtering that was required along side a GET.

How did you decide on certain response codes?

From my knowledge certain response codes correlate to certain meanigns, so if a error arises from a bad user input typicall you would use a error code in teh ramge of 400. This thought process was help consistent through other erros also.
